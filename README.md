# NodeJs_DrawAndGuess
### NodeJs DrawAndGuess
###### 1.You need a nodejs environment.
###### 2.Operate nodejs and cd to "NodeJs_DrawAndGuess/serve/" and run "server.js".
###### 3.Open the "index.html" with your favorite browser 4 times(because we must have 4 players).
###### 4.Here you go!
###### This is my first NodeJs practice, so it must have some bugs...ignore it!→_→
